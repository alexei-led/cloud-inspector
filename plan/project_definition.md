## New Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Iterative, Agent-like Debugging Process

**Implement an Agent Loop Model:**

- Adopt an iterative process where the AI observes, plans, acts, and receives feedback.
- This enables handling of branching logic and decision-making based on real-time data.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Observation:** AI analyzes the user query and current context.
2. **Planning:** AI decides the next specific action (internal chain-of-thought).
3. **Action:** Generate a brief, targeted script for the specific check.
4. **Execution:** Run the script and collect the results.
5. **Feedback:** Provide execution results back to the AI.
6. **Iteration:** Repeat the loop until the issue is resolved or sufficient data is collected.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

    G[Provide Feedback to AI]
    H{Issue Resolved?}
    I[End]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H
    H -- Yes --> I
    H -- No --> B
```

### 2. State Management and Context Tracking

- **Structured Schema for Partial Results:**
  - Use a structured format (e.g., JSON) to store results from each execution step.
  - Example:

    ```json
    {
      "step": "Check EC2 instance state",
      "output": {
        "instanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
        "state": "running"
      }
    }
    ```

- **Contextual Data Storage:**
  - Maintain a knowledge base of discovered facts to inform subsequent steps.

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling and Correction

- **Runtime Error Detection:**
  - Capture exceptions and error messages during script execution.
