# Project: LLM Code Generation Comparison for Cloud Inspection (AWS focus initially)

**Objective:** Develop a Python-based system using LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith to generate and execute cloud inspection code. The system should:

1. Use predefined prompts to generate canonical Python code for cloud resource inspection
2. Generate new prompts using reasoning models
3. Execute generated code in isolated environments
4. Automatically fix syntax and API-related errors based on execution feedback
5. Support comprehensive cloud inspection including resources, configurations, metrics, and logs
6. Compare different LLM models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Local, Amazon Bedrock) for:
   * Code generation quality and correctness
   * Cost efficiency and performance
   * Problem-solving capabilities
7. Support end-to-end troubleshooting workflow:
   * Convert user problems into code generation prompts
   * Generate and execute inspection code
   * Collect and format data for agent consumption
   * Provide context for problem resolution

**Current Implementation Status:**

1. **Prompt Management:** ✅
    * YAML-based prompt system implemented

    * Code formatting and validation
    * Automatic import management
    * Token limit handling with continuation support

4. **Code Review and Correction:** ✅
    * Syntax validation
    * Import statement verification
    * Basic security checks
    * Automatic code formatting (black, autopep8, autoflake)

5. **Output Management:** ✅
    * Organized output directory structure
    * Metadata tracking
    * LangSmith integration for monitoring
    * Result filtering and statistics

6. **AWS Focus:** ✅
    * Initial AWS prompts implemented
    * boto3 integration
    * IAM policy generation
    * Service-specific templates

**New Enhancement Opportunities:**

    * Add execution result analysis

2. **Sandbox Environment:**
    * Docker container execution support
    * Python venv management
    * Resource access configuration
    * Execution isolation and cleanup

3. **Automated Error Correction:**
    * Runtime error detection
    * API error analysis
    * Code modification suggestions
    * Automatic fix application

4. **Advanced Analysis:**
    * Static code analysis integration (e.g., Bandit for security)
    * Cost estimation for AWS operations
    * Resource usage optimization suggestions
    * Compliance checking (e.g., AWS Well-Architected Framework)

5. **Testing Enhancement:**
    * Automated test case generation
    * Mock data creation
    * Integration test templates
    * Local execution simulation

6. **User Experience:**

    * Improve error analysis models
    * Add code correction models

8. **Multi-Cloud Support:**
    * GCP template system
    * Azure integration
    * Cross-cloud resource mapping
    * Cloud-agnostic abstractions

9. **LLM Comparison Framework:**
    * Model performance tracking
    * Cost analysis system
    * Quality metrics collection
    * Comparative analysis reporting

10. **Problem-Solving Workflow:**
    * Problem-to-prompt conversion
    * Context extraction from results
    * Data formatting for agents
    * Solution suggestion system

**Important Considerations:**

* Maintain high code quality standards
